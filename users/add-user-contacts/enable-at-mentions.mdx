title: "Enable @ Mentions & User Tagging"
description: "For some features like Comments, your users should be able to @mention or tag other users. You can enable autocomplete and show a contacts dropdown by using this feature."

### 1) Set a user group

Users in the same group get added to each other's contact list.

They can then access this list across all the features wherever a contact list is needed. Eg: @mention other users in comments to tag or assign tasks.

Over time, as users from the same `groupId` sign in, they will be automatically added to each other's contact list.

### 2) Manually bootstrap user contact list

Bootstrap with the complete contact list from the get go.
In the previous step, the users will only get added to each others' contact list as & when users in the group log in.

To show the entire user contact list from the get go, you need to manually provide us the list of user contacts during the `identify()` call.

You still need to implement the previous step. Then set the contacts field with a `UserContact` list. In the `UserContact` object you need to set the `visibility` field to `'group'`.

### 3) Add private contacts (optional)

Make some contacts private to the current user.

In the UserContact object set the `visibility` field to `'private'`. This will add all such contacts to only this User's contact list.
