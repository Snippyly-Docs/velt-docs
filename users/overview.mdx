## Users

A User represents a person who has been authenticated with the Velt SDK. 

Once a User has been authenticated, their profile can be seen within Velt's collaboration features.

For example in the Comments feature, the user's name is shown by their comment and in @mentions.

Additionally in the Presence and in Cursors features, the user's name is shown by their avatar bubble and mouse cursors.

## User schema

A User has the following schema:

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| userId | string | The user's unique identifier. |
| name | string | The user's display name. |
| email | string | The user's email address. |
| photoUrl | string | The URL of the user's profile photo. |
| groupId  | string | Your user's group ID |                                   
| contacts | UserContact[] | An array of User Contact objects |
| plan     | string | Your user's plan |


## User groups

Users in the same group get added to each other's contact list.

Over time, as users from the same `groupId` sign in, they will be automatically added to each other's contact list.

They can then @mention or assign each other when they make comments.


## User contacts list

User contacts are used to load the list of people that a user can @mention or assign when they make a comment .

A User has a `contacts` attribute that has an array of User Contact objects. A User Contact has the following schema:


| Field     | Type                | Description                                               |
| --------  | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| userId    | string              | Unique user identifier that you use to identify your user |
| name      | string | Your user's full name                                     |
| photoUrl  | string | Your user's avatar URL                                    |
| email     | string | Your user's email                                         |
| groupId   | string | Your user's group ID |
| visibility| string | Either 'private' or 'group'|

You can set the User contacts to be empty initially or you can preload it with a list of contacts upon user authentication.

### User contact visibility

The `visibility` attribute on a User Contact object is either set to `private` or `group`.

When it is set to `private`, they will only be added to the authenticated User's contact list and will not be added to any other User's contact list even if a `groupId` is specified.

When it is set to `group`, they will be added to the contact lists of all User's with the same groupId.
