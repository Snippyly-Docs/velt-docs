### 1) Enable Flock mode on Presence
Enable Flock mode feature.

You need to add Presence feature to trigger Flock mode. This will enable Flock mode as an option for your users globally, wherever Presence is shown.

To start the shared flock session, click on a user's avatar to start following them.

### 2) Test Integration

Test it out by opening the target page in two browsers with two different users logged in.

You should see the avatars of the users rendered where you added the presence component. Now click on any avatar to start following them.
