  <Tab title="React">
## 1) Set inactivity time
Set the time it takes for a user to go inactive in milliseconds.

By default we mark a user as inactive if they do not take any action on the document within a 5 mins timeframe.

If they unfocus the tab, we mark them inactive immediately.

## 2) Add Presence to a Location

Show users' presence on a `Location`.

Set the `location` attribute on the Presence element. When there are users at that location, their avatars will show in this Presence element.

Eg: For a Presentation tool, you can add `Presence` component at the main `document` level and add another `Presence` component on the slide thumbnails. This will render avatars at both presentation level & slide thumbnail level. For slide thumbnails, it will only show users active on that slide.

## 3) Set max users

Set how many Presence avatars to display at a time.

You can set this via the maxUsers attribute. Any extra avatars will be hidden and shown in an avatar which indicates the number of extra users.

## 4) Enable Flock Mode

Enable Flock Mode Feature.

This will enable Flock mode as an option for your users globally, wherever Presence is shown.

To start the shared flock session, click on a user's avatar to start following them.

Learn more about it in the Flock Mode feature section.

## 5) Subscribe to changes in User Presence

Whenever the presence for any user changes, we emit this event with the updated list of users currently online on this document.

## 1) Set inactivity time

Set the time it takes for a user to go inactive.

By default a user will go inactive after 5 minutes. If they unfocus the tab, then they will immediately go inactive.

## 2) Add Presence to child documents

Show users' presence on child documents.

Set the location attribute on the Presence element. When there are users at that location, their avatars will show in this Presence element.

## 3) Set max users

Max users determines how many Presence avatars to display at a time.

You can set this via the max-users attribute. Any extra avatars will be hidden and shown in an avatar which indicates the number of extra users.
