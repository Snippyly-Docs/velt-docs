## Video Player Sync

`Video Player Sync` allows users to sync their video player with other `Users` in the same document. 

This lets all `Users` watch the same video at the same time. 

To enable `Video Player Sync` in any video, user will just have to add data-sync-video-player="true" attribute in video tag.

```html
<video data-sync-video-player="true"></video>
```
