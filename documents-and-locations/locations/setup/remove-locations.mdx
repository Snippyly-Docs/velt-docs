## Adding multiple Locations


<Steps>


<Step title="Removing all Locations">

To remove all locations, use the `client.removeLocation()` method.

```jsx
client.removeLocation()
```


</Step>

<Step title="Removing specific Locations">

If you have added multiple locations and only want to remove one of them, you can remove it by using `client.removeLocation()` and by passing in the exact location object you want to remove.

```jsx
// remove specific location
const locationToRemove = {
	// your custom location object
}
Velt.removeLocation(locationToRemove);
```


</Step>
