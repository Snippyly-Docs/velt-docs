## Email Notifications

You can enable email notifications to send out emails whenever you @mention a user in the Comments feature or when another user replies to your comment.

To enable Email Notifications go to the Configurations -> Email Service in the Velt Console, or [click here](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/config/email)

## Default Emails vs SendGrid 

By default, emails will be sent from a Velt email address. If you wish to use your own Sendgrid account, you can do so.

To enable Sendgrid, please enter your:
 - SendGrid API Key 
 - SendGrid Email Template ID for Comments feature
 - SendGrid Email Template ID for Tags feature
 - 'From' Email Address


## Email Template Data

The following fields will be injected by Velt to your Email Template:
- name 
- subject
