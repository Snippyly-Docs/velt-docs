## 1) Customize navigation for non-URL based navigation
**By default, we attempt to navigate the user to the comment location when a user clicks on one in the sidebar.**

You can pass a function which returns additional context associated with that comment, for example: what current tab or page of a table the comment lives on.

## 2) Provide additional context for comment location

**The function should return any context you want saved.**

When we return the location data of the comment, you can access the context field that was saved when the comment was created.

## 3) Provide an event handler for when a comment is clicked
**When a comment is clicked, the handler will be called with the location data of the comment.**

Using this handler, you can fetch the context and make the necessary state changes to locate the comment correctly.

<ResponseField name="documentId" type="string">
The document ID where the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="location" type="string">
The location where the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="targetElementId" type="string">
The DOM ID of the target element on which the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="Object | undefined">
Any context data passed when the comment was added
</ResponseField>

## 1) Customize navigation for non-URL based navigation

**By default, we attempt to navigate the user to the comment location when a user clicks on one in the sidebar.**

We provide an event where you can set additional context associated with that comment, for example: what current tab or page of a table the comment lives on.

**The event handler should call the callback with any context you want saved.**
