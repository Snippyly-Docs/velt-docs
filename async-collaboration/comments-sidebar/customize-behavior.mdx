## 1) Customize navigation for non-URL based navigation
**By default, we attempt to navigate the user to the comment Location when a user clicks on one in the sidebar.**

If you want to alter this behavior, you can listen to click events and add an event listener to handle the navigation in a custom way.


### 1a) Custom navigation using Location

Using the onCommentClick handler, you can fetch the context and make the necessary state changes to locate the comment correctly.

**When a comment is clicked, the handler will be called with the location data of the comment.**

<ResponseField name="documentId" type="string">
The document ID where the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="location" type="string">
The location where the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="targetElementId" type="string">
The DOM ID of the target element on which the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="Object | undefined">
Any context data passed when the comment was added
</ResponseField>


```js
 <VeltCommentsSidebar onCommentClick={onCommentClick} /> 
```

```js
// event handler for when a comment is clicked on 
const onCommentClick = (event) => {
  //handle custom navigation by getting location
  const { pageId } = event.location;
  yourNavigateToPageMethod(pageId);
```

### 1b) Custom navigation without using Location

If you do not want to use Location, you can alternatively handle custom navigation by calling the `addContext()` method in the event handler.


```js
 <VeltCommentsSidebar onCommentClick={onCommentClick} /> 
```

```js
// event handler for when a comment is clicked on 
const onCommentClick = (event) => {
  //handle custom navigation by getting context
  const { pageId } = event.context;
  yourNavigateToPageMethod(pageId);
};
```

<Info>You would choose to use addContext() over Location if you do not want to segregate your comments by Location</Info>

## 2) Enable/Disable Sidebar URL Navigation

`Default: false`

By default, `Comment Sidebar` URL navigation is disabled. So when user clicks on any comment in the sidebar, we will not redirect the user to a different page url if the comment was located on a different page. You would need to listen to `onCommentClick` events and then handle the event to change the URL.

To enable Sidebar URL Navigation, you can set the `urlNavigation` attribute to `true`. When this is enabled, clicking on Sidebar comments will change the page URL to wherever the comment was added.

```jsx
{/* `true` to enable sidebar url navigation, `false` to disable sidebar url navigation */}
<VeltCommentsSidebar urlNavigation={true} />
```

You can also use API methods:

```js
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
// to enable sidebar url navigation
commentElement.enableSidebarUrlNavigation();
// to disable sidebar url navigation
commentElement.disableSidebarUrlNavigation();
```

// event handler for when a comment is clicked on

  //handle custom navigation by getting context

## 2) Enable/Disable Sidebar URL Navigation

`Default: false`

By default, `Comment Sidebar` URL navigation is disabled. So when user clicks on any comment in the sidebar, we will not redirect the user to a different page url if the comment was located on a different page. You would need to listen to `onCommentClick` events and then handle the event to change the URL.

To enable Sidebar URL Navigation, you can set the `urlNavigation` attribute to `true`. When this is enabled, clicking on Sidebar comments will change the page URL to wherever the comment was added.

```js
<!-- `true` to enable sidebar url navigation, `false` to disable sidebar url navigation -->
<velt-comments-sidebar url-navigation="false"></velt-comments-sidebar>
```

You can also use API methods:

```js
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
// to enable sidebar url navigation
commentElement.enableSidebarUrlNavigation();
// to disable sidebar url navigation
commentElement.disableSidebarUrlNavigation();
```
