### 1) Import Comment components
**Import the `VeltComments` component and the `VeltCommentTool` component.**

### 2) Add Comments component with Popover mode

**Add the `VeltComments` component to the root of your app and mark the `popoverMode` property as true.**

This component is required to render comments in your app.

Popover mode means that comments can be attached to specific target elements. The UX pattern is very similar to commenting in Google Sheets.

### 3) Add Comment Tool component

**Add the `VeltCommentTool` component on each component where you want to enable commenting.**

For example, in a table you could add this tool to each cell and show it on hover or right click context menu.

You must specify a target element ID which binds the tool to that element. When users click on the comment tool, it will attach a comment to the target element.

Once the comment is saved, you will notice a triangle on the top right corner of the element indicating that a comment is present on this element.

### 4) Add the Comment Bubble component

**(optional) This component accepts a target element ID & binds to the comment associated with it.**

It also shows the total number of threads in the given comment.

This gives you a lot of flexibility as you can place this component anywhere and provides a more obvious affordance to your users.

### 5) Test Integration

**Test it out by opening the page with Velt components in your browser.**

Click on the comment tool and leave a comment on the target element.

### 1) Add Comment component with POpover mode
**Add the comment component to your template.**

This component is required to render comments in your app.

### 2) Add the Comment tool component

**The comment tool allows you to add comments.**

When you click on the comment tool, it initiates comment mode. In Freestyle mode, you can attach comments to any elements on the page.

### 3) Add the Comment Bubble component

**The comment bubble shows the total number of threads, and allows users to open the comment associated with a given target element.**

It acts as an indicator -- your users can see how many comments were left on an element at first glance. Like the Comment Tool, you must specify a target comment element ID.

### 4) Test Integration

**Test it out by adding a comment.**

You should be able to leave a comment on the target element using the comment tool.
