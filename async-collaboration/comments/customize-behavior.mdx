Currently, categories are used in the AI autocategorize feature where we autmatically categorize your comments if you enabled the autoCategorize feature. These categories are also used in the comments sidebar to filter comments by category.

The `color` property is used to set the category pill background color.


```js
<VeltComments customCategory={[
  {
    "id": "bug",
    "name": "Bug",
    "color": "red"
  }
]}/>
````

## 22) Set Custom Priorites

Pass custom priorities in the customPriority prop.

With custom priorities, you can replace the default priorities with your own values. These priorities are also used in the comment sidebar to filter comments by priority.

This will work if you have enabled the priority feature.

The `color` property is used to set the category pill background color.

The `lightColor` property sets the background color of the filter.


```js

<VeltComments customPriority={[
  {
    "id": "low",
    "name": "Low",
    "color": "red",
    "lightColor": "pink",
  },
]}/>
```

## 23) Set Custom Statuses

Set custom statuses in the `customStatus` prop.

Default statuses: Open, In Progress, Resolved.

With custom statuses, you can replace the default statuses with your own values. These statuses are also used in the comment sidebar to filter comments by status.

Setting the Status type using the `type` property:
  - default: This will be the default status assigned to each comment.
  - ongoing: This is treated as an intermediary status, you can add as many statuses with type ongoing as you want.
  - terminal: This represents a status that is completed. Comments with this status type are no longer shown in the DOM.

Setting the Status Icon using the `svg` property:
  - You can pass in a serialized SVG. We automatically parse and colorize SVGs. If insptead you pass in an icon URL, you will have to colorize each icon yourself to match the status color.

```js
<VeltComments customStatus={[
  {
    "id": "open",
    "name": "Open",
    "color": "white",
    "type": "default",
    "iconUrl": "", // Pass in an icon URL
    "svg": "<svg></svg>" // Pass in a serialized SVG
  },
]}/>
```

## 24) Ability to accept or reject comments

To accept comments, set the `suggestionMode` attribute to `true`.


```js

````



## 25) To retrieve comments in the frontend

To retrieve comments in the frontend, call getCommentElement() on the Velt client and then `subscribe()` to `getAllCommentAnnotations()` and pass in a callback function.

```js
if (client) {
  const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
  commentElement.getAllCommentAnnotations().subscribe((comments) => {
    // Do something with the comments
  });
}
```

## 26) To retrieve comments in the backend

For this you should use our Webhook service. Let's say you want to be notified whenever a comment is added or updated, you can provide us an endpoint and we will send the comment data to that end point as and when there is an update. You can then process it further. Note that you cannot retrieve historical comments using this.

You can enable and configure webhook in your Velt Console as shown below. After you enable this, you need to provide an endpoint url. We will make a post request to that endpoint to send the comment data.

To read more about how to configure webhooks, check out the [webhooks documentation](/webhooks/overview).

## 28) Show/Hide comments on DOM

By default, all the comments will be visible on DOM whenever we are able to detect to elements for that. But users can hide it from DOM if required.

There are 2 ways to show/hide comments on DOM:

Configuring attributes on the React Component:
```js
{/* `true` to show comments, `false` to hide comments */}
<VeltComments commentsOnDom={false} />
```

Using API methods:
```js
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
// to show comments on DOM
commentElement.showCommentsOnDom();
// to hide comments on DOM
commentElement.hideCommentsOnDom();
```

## 29) Enable/Disable adding comments

By default, this feature is enabled, so users can add pin comments, area comments or text comments. But if they want to disable this feature to add comments, then they can disable/enable it through the ways mentioned below:

```js
{/* `true` to enable adding comments, `false` to disable adding comments */}
<VeltComments commentTool={false} />
```

Using API methods:
```js
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
// to enable adding comments
commentElement.enableCommentTool();
// to disable adding comments
commentElement.disableCommentTool();
```

## 30) Listen to onCommentAccept and onCommentReject events
JavaScript

```js
<VeltComments onCommentAccept={(event)=>yourMethod(event)}/>
<VeltComments onCommentReject={(event)=>yourMethod(event)}/>
```

Response:

```js
{
    "annotationId": "ANNOTATION_ID",
    "actionUser": {
        // user object
    },
    "actionType": "accept", // accept or reject
    "annotation": {
        // raw annotation object

Whether to enable Sign In button on comment dialog when user is anonymous or signed out.

`Default: false`

```html
<velt-comments on-comment-updated="yourMethod()"></velt-comments>
```

## 21) Set Custom Categories

Pass custom categories in the customCategory prop.

Default categories: Question, Feedback, Bug, Other.

With custom categories, you can replace the default categories with your own values.

Currently, categories are used in the AI autocategorize feature where we autmatically categorize your comments if you enabled the autoCategorize feature. These categories are also used in the comments sidebar to filter comments by category.

color: Set the category pill background color.

```html
<velt-comments custom-category='[
  "id": "bug",
  "name": "Bug",
  "color": "red"]'
></velt-comments>
```


## 22) Set Custom Priorites

Pass custom priorities in the customPriority prop.

Default priorities: P0, P1, P2.

With custom priorities, you can replace the default priorities with your own values. These priorities are also used in the comment sidebar to filter comments by priority.

This will work if you have enabled the priority feature.

color: Sets the icon color.

lightColor: Sets the background color of the filter.


```html
<velt-comments custom-priority="[
          {
            "id": "low",
            "name": "Low",
            "color": "red",
            "lightColor": "pink",
          }]"
></velt-comments>
```



## 23) Set Custom Statuses

Set custom statuses in the customStatus prop.

Default statuses: Open, In Progress, Resolved.

With custom statuses, you can replace the default statuses with your own values. These statuses are also used in the comment sidebar to filter comments by status.

1. Set Status type:
   default: This will be the default status assigned to each comment.
   ongoing: This is treated as an intermediary status, you can add as many statuses with type ongoing as you want.
   terminal: This represents a status that is completed. Comments with this status type are no longer shown in the DOM.

2. Set Status Icon:
   You can pass in a serialized SVG. We automatically parse and colorize SVGs. If insptead you pass in an icon URL, you will have to colorize each icon yourself to match the status color.



```html
<velt-comments custom-priority="[
  {
    "id": "open",
    "name": "Open",
    "color": "white",
    "type": "default",
    "iconUrl": "", // Pass in an icon URL
    "svg": "<svg></svg>" // Pass in a serialized SVG
  }]"
></velt-comments>
```

## 24) Ability to accept or reject comments

To accept comments, set suggestion-mode to `true`.

```html
<velt-comments
	suggestion-mode="true">
</velt-comments>
```


## 25) To retrieve comments in the frontend

To retrieve comments in the frontend, call getCommentElement() on the Velt client and then subscribe() to getAllCommentAnnotations() and pass in a callback function.

```html
if (Velt) {
  const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
  commentElement.getAllCommentAnnotations().subscribe((comments) => {
    // Do something with the comments
  });
}
```

## 26) To retrieve comments in the backend

For this you should use our Webhook service. Let's say you want to be notified whenever a comment is added or updated, you can provide us an endpoint and we will send the comment data to that end point as and when there is an update. You can then process it further. Note that you cannot retrieve historical comments using this.

You can enable and configure webhook in your Velt Console as shown below. After you enable this, you need to provide an endpoint url. We will make a post request to that endpoint to send the comment data.

## 27) Enable Dark Mode

To enable dark mode, set the `dark-mode` attribute to `true`:

```html
<velt-comments
	dark-mode="true">
</velt-comments>

<velt-comment-tool
	dark-mode="true">
</velt-comment-tool>
```

## 28) Show/Hide comments on DOM

By default, all the comments will be visible on DOM whenever we are able to detect to elements for that. But users can hide it from DOM if required.

There are 2 ways to show/hide comments on DOM:

Configuring attributes on the React Component:
```js
{/* `true` to show comments, `false` to hide comments */}
<velt-comments comments-on-dom="false"></velt-comments>
```

Using API methods:
```js
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
// to show comments on DOM
commentElement.showCommentsOnDom();
// to hide comments on DOM
commentElement.hideCommentsOnDom();
```

## 29) Enable/Disable adding comments

By default, this feature is enabled, so users can add pin comments, area comments or text comments. But if they want to disable this feature to add comments, then they can disable/enable it through the ways mentioned below:

```js
{/* `true` to enable adding comments, `false` to disable adding comments */}
<velt-comments comment-tool="false"></velt-comments>
```

Using API methods:
```js
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
// to enable adding comments
commentElement.enableCommentTool();
// to disable adding comments
commentElement.disableCommentTool();
```

## 30) Listen to onCommentAccept and onCommentReject events
JavaScript

```js
const veltCommentsTag = document.querySelector('velt-comments');

veltCommentsTag?.addEventListener('onCommentAccept', (event) => {
  console.log('*** onCommentAccept ***');
  console.log(event.detail);
});

veltCommentsTag?.addEventListener('onCommentReject', (event) => {
  console.log('*** onCommentReject ***');
  console.log(event.detail);
});
```

Response:

```js
{
    "annotationId": "ANNOTATION_ID",
    "actionUser": {
        // user object
    },
    "actionType": "accept", // accept or reject
    "annotation": {
        // raw annotation object
    },
  	"replaceContentHtml": "HTML_FORMATTED_TEXT_TO_REPLACE", // optional
  	"replaceContentText": "PLAIN_TEXT_TO_REPLACE", // optional
}
```
