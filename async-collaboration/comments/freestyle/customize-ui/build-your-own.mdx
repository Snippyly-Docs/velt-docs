## 1) Get the Velt client

Import the `useVeltClient` React hook.

You can use this hook within your component to fetch the Velt client.

```js
import { VeltComments, useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';
```

## 2) Create a useEffect hook

Create an effect with the `client` as a dependency.

Make sure to check if the `client` is `null` or `undefined` before you use it.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (client) {
    const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
  }
}, [client]);
```

## 3) Filter comments by document id and location (optional)

You can fetch the comments that correspond to a document and location.

You can pass a document in by itself or with a corresponding location. We will send back an `Observable` which will listen to comment changes for that document and location.

```js
// Provide your own logic to determine the documentId and location
const documentId = 'example-document-id';

const location = {
  page: 'example-page'
};

```
## 4) Subscribe to comments

Subscribe to constant comment changes.

We will send you a new list of comments everytime there is a change so you can build out your own user UI and logic. You can pass in a `documentId` and `location` to filter out unwanted comments.

```js
commentElement.getAllCommentAnnotations(documentId, location).subscribe((comments) => {
  // Do something with comments list
});

```

## 1) Import the Velt Script tag
```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@veltdev/sdk@1.0.11/velt.js" onload="loadVelt()"></script>
```

## 2) Initialize with your API Key

Put this in your root app script:
```js
async function loadVelt() {
    await Velt.init("YOUR_VELT_API_KEY");
}
```
