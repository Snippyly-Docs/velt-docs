## 1) Get the Velt client

Import the `useVeltClient` React hook.

You can use this hook within your component to fetch the Velt client.

## 2) Create a useEffect hook

Create an effect with the `client` as a dependency.

Make sure to check if the `client` is `null` or `undefined` before you use it.

## 3) Filter comments by document id and location (optional)

You can fetch the comments that correspond to a document and location.

You can pass a document in by itself or with a corresponding location. We will send back an `Observable` which will listen to comment changes for that document and location.

## 4) Subscribe to comments

Subscribe to constant comment changes.

We will send you a new list of comments everytime there is a change so you can build out your own user UI and logic. You can pass in a `documentId` and `location` to filter out unwanted comments.
