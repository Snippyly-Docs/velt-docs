  </head>
  <body>
    <snippyly-comments></snippyly-comments>

### 1) Add Comment component with Popover mode
**Add the comment component to your template.**

This component is required to render comments in your app. Popover mode means that comments can be attached to specific target elements.

### 2) Add the Comment Tool component

The comment tool allows you to add comments.

When you click on the comment tool, it initiates comment mode. In Popover mode, you must specify a target comment element ID which links the tool to that element.

### 3) Add the Comment Bubble component

The comment bubble shows the total number of threads, and allows users to open the comment associated with a given target element.

It acts as an indicator -- your users can see how many comments were left on an element at first glance. Like the Comment Tool, you must specify a target comment element ID.

### 4) Test Integration

**Test it out by adding a comment.**

You should be able to leave a comment on the target element using the comment tool.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Comment documentation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <snippyly-comments popover-mode="true"></snippyly-comments>

    <div class="toolbar">
      <snippyly-comment-tool
        target-comment-element-id="some-element"
      ></snippyly-comment-tool>
    </div>

    <div id="some-element">
      <snippyly-comment-bubble
        target-comment-element-id="some-element"
      ></snippyly-comment-bubble>

</html>
```

This component is required to render comments in your app. Stream mode renders a stream view of comments in a column.

### 2) Add the Stream View container ID (optional)

Pass the container ID of the scrolling element to help us position the stream of comments.

Alternatively, you can move the Comment component tag to inside whatever scrolling element to help position the comment stream correctly.

The comment tool allows you to add comments.

When you click on the comment tool, it initiates comment mode.
