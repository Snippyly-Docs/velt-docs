## Customize for `Location` specific tracking

If you want to specify `Location` specific tracking, you can add two additional properties:
  - type - this should be either 'document' or 'location' (default: 'location')
  - location-id - if type is 'location', you can provide a location id here

```jsx
<div className="toolbar">
  <VeltViewAnalytics type="location" location-id="MY_LOCATION_ID" />
</div>
```

API Methods:
```jsx
const viewsElement = client.getViewsElement();

// to get unique views by user
viewsElement.getUniqueViewsByUser().subscribe((viewsByUser) => {
	console.log('Unique views by user: ', viewsByUser);
});
// you can optionally pass client-location-id to get unique views by users for that location
viewsElement.getUniqueViewsByUser('your-location-id').subscribe((viewsByUser) => {
	console.log('Unique views by date for location: ', viewsByUser);
});

// to get unique views by date
viewsElement.getUniqueViewsByDate().subscribe((viewsByDate) => {
	console.log('Unique views by date: ', viewsByDate);
});
// you can optionally pass client-location-id to get unique views by date for that location
viewsElement.getUniqueViewsByDate('your-location-id').subscribe((viewsByDate) => {
	console.log('Unique views by date for location: ', viewsByDate);
});
```


Hooks:

```jsx
import { useUniqueViewsByDate, useUniqueViewsByUser } from '@veltdev/react';
// to get document level views by date
const viewsByDate = useUniqueViewsByDate();
// to get location level views by date
const viewsByDateForLocation = useUniqueViewsByDate('your-location-id');

// to get document level views by user
const viewsByUser = useUniqueViewsByUser();
// to get location level views by user
const viewsByUserForLocation = useUniqueViewsByUser('your-location-id');
```
