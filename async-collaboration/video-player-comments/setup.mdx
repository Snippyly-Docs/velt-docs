## 1) Import Comment components

**Import the `VeltComments`,`VeltCommentTool`, `VeltProvider`, and `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline` components.**

```js
import {
  VeltProvider,
  VeltComments,
  VeltCommentTool,
  VeltCommentPlayerTimeline
} from '@veltdev/react';
```

## 2) Add Comments component

**Add the `VeltComments` component to the root of your app.**

This component is required to render comments in your app.

```js
<VeltProvider apiKey="API_KEY">
  <VeltComments />
</VeltProvider>
```

## 3) Place the `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline` component as a sibling to your video player
To add a commentable timeline for a video player, add the `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline` component as a sibling to your video player component.

It will auto adjust to the same width as your video player.


```jsx
<div>
  <YourVideoPlayer/>
  <VeltCommentPlayerTimeline/>
</div>
```

<Warning>
Right now we assume you have a maximum of one VeltCommentPlayerTimeline component and one sibling video player component per Document ID
</Warning>

## 4) Set the totalMediaLength

You can pass an integer to `totalMediaLength` using props to represent the total number of frames or seconds in the video:

```jsx
<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline totalMediaLength={120} />
```

Alternatively, you can set this using API method calls:

```jsx
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.setTotalMediaLength(120);
```

## 5) Handle onCommentClick event to sync video player timeline with timestamp of clicked Comment

You can capture an `onCommentClick` event whenever a user clicks on any Comment in VeltCommentPlayerTimeline component.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
	
	const onCommentClick = (data) => {
		console.log("onCommentClick data: ", data);
	}

	return (
		...
		<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline onCommentClick={(data) => onCommentClick(data)} />
		...
	)
}
```

The Comment data will be in the following format:

<ResponseField name="documentId" type="string">
The document ID where the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="location" type="string">
The location where the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="targetElementId" type="string">
The DOM ID of the target element on which the comment was added
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="Object | undefined">
Any context data passed when the comment was added
</ResponseField>


In your callback, you can use the Comment data **location** field to set the video player timeline to the same timestamp that is associated with the Comment that was just clicked.

      </div>
    </VeltProvider>
  );
