You can add it whever you want it to appear. Eg: You can add it in your comment input box container where users type the comment.

We support 2 modes:
 - "thread": The preview is shown wherever you put this component.
 - "floating": (default) The preview is shown on the bottom left of the page no matter where you put this component.


To add the Recorder Control Panel:

```js
import { VeltRecorderControlPanel, VeltRecorderTool } from '@veltdev/react'

function TaskInputBox() {
    return (
    	//... rest of the component code...
      <VeltRecorderControlPanel mode="thread" />

      //... rest of the component code...
    )
}
```
