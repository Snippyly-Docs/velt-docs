## Advanced Set Up options

This section includes a list of optional advanced set up options.

## Location

Users logged into the same **Document** ID can see each other's `Presence`, `Cursors`, `Comments` etc. 

However, if you want to add another layer of categorization to organize users together, you can use **Location**.

<Tip> If a **Document** is like a house, a **Location** is like a room within the house. </Tip>

To learn more about `Locations`, check out its dedicated section [here](/documents-and-locations/locations/setup).

## Contacts

When you reply to a comment, you can `@mention` other teammates that are added to a `User's Contacts List`.

To learn more about creating a `User's Contacts List`, [read here](https://docs.velt.dev/users/overview).
