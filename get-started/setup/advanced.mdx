## Advanced Set Up options

This section includes a list of optional advanced set up options.

## Location

> If a **Document** is like a building, what are the rooms?

A **Location** is like a _Room_. Users in the same room can talk to each other, see each other, and interact in real-time! **Locations** are _completely optional_, you can opt to use them or not. If you opt to use **Locations**, users in the same **Document** must also be in the same **Location** now to interact. A **Location** can be described using any plain JSON object.

> What if I don't set the **Document**?

Your user won't be able to interact with _anyone_!

> What if I don't want to use **Locations**?

If the complexity of your application does not require the use of **Locations**, you can use **Documents** by themselves to group your users together.



In this example, we set the **Document ID** as `some_document_id`, and the **Location** to an object with an ID property and value of `1`. _If you specify a **Location**_, users in the same **Document** will no longer be able to interact if they are not also in the same **Location**.

```js 
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      client.setDocumentID('some_document_id');
      client.setLocation({id: 1});
    }
  }, [client]);

  return ();
}
```

The `setLocation()` method is used to set your app's location and takes in any kind of custom key-value paired object.

This object could represent your app's pages, sections, versions, frames (in video editor), data points on maps/charts etc. 

This means that this object can represent one or all of these dimensions at once: pages, sections, versions, frames (in video editor), data points on maps/charts etc. 

```jsx
client.setLocation({
  'page': 'mainPage',
  'version': 'v1.2',
  'videoFrame': '120'
  // You can keep adding more field to make the location very specific.
  // The field names can be anything.
})
```

### Multiple Locations

One neat feature of **Locations** is that the user can actually be in multiple locations at once!

To do this, use the `addLocation()` method for as many locations as you want. The `addLocation()` method takes in key-value paired objects just like `setLocation()`.

```js 
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      client.setDocumentID('some_document_id');
      client.addLocation({id: 1});
      client.addLocation({id: 2});
    }
  }, [client]);

  return ();
}
```

In this example, the user will have access to both location 1 and location 2!

### Location data attributes

If you don't want to use JavaScript to set the client location, you can alternatively use data attributes. Add the `data-velt-location` attribute to the top level of an element where you want to set the custom location object.


```html
<div class="container">
  // If you want to add comments to location {"key1": "value1"}, if it is added inside below div
  // then add location attribute to below div as mentioned here
  <div class="sub-container" data-velt-location='{"key1": "value1"}'>
    <div class="card">
      ... any content ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

  **Note:** Make sure that you are converting object to string before setting it to location attribute.
