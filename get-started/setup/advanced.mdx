## Advanced Set Up options

This section includes a list of optional advanced set up options.

## Location

Users logged into the same **Document** ID can see each other's presence, cursors, comments etc. 

However, if you want to add another layer of categorization to organize users together, you can use **Location**.

For an example, for a Collaborative Slide Presentation application, the **Document** would represent the entire slide presentation while the **Location** would represent an individual slide.

As another example, for a Collaborative Video Editor, the **Document** would represent the entire video player while the **Location** would represent the timestamp of the video.

<Tip> If a **Document** is like a house, a **Location** is like a room within the house. </Tip>

**Locations** are _completely optional_, you can opt to use them or not. If the complexity of your application does not require the use of **Locations**, you can use **Documents** by themselves to group your users together.

If you opt to use **Locations**, users in the same **Document** must also be in the same **Location** now to interact. 

A **Location** can be described using any plain JSON object and can be set using the `setLocation()` method.

This object could represent your app's pages, sections, versions, video frames, or data points on maps/charts etc. 

```jsx
client.setLocation({
  'page': 'mainPage',
  'version': 'v1.2',
  'videoFrame': '120'
  // You can keep adding more field to make the location very specific.
  // The field names can be anything.
})
```

If you specify a **Location**, users in the same **Document** will no longer be able to interact if they are not also in the same **Location**.

To use a **Location** together with a **Document**, simply call the **setDocumentID()** method before the **setLocation()** method.

```js 
client.setDocumentID('some_document_id');
client.setLocation({
  'page': 'mainPage',
  'version': 'v1.2',
  'videoFrame': '120'
  // You can keep adding more field to make the location very specific.
  // The field names can be anything.
})
```

To remove a location that has already been set, you can use the `client.removeLocation()` method:

```jsx
client.removeLocation()
```
