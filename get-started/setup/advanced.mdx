## Advanced Set Up options

This section includes a list of optional advanced set up options.

## Location

Users logged into the same **Document** ID can see each other's `Presence`, `Cursors`, `Comments` etc. 

However, if you want to add another layer of categorization to organize users together, you can use **Location**.

<Tip> If a **Document** is like a house, a **Location** is like a room within the house. </Tip>

To learn more about `Locations`, check out its dedicated section [here](/documents-and-locations/locations/setup).

## Contacts

When you reply to a comment, you can `@mention` other teammates that are added to a `User's Contacts List`.

To learn more about creating a `User's Contacts List`, [read here](https://docs.velt.dev/users/overview).

## Replace Private and Group Contacts Separately

If you want to replace Private and Group Contacts separately, you can configure it in the `userOptions` parameter in the `identify(user, userOptions)` method.

To do so, set the following attributes to `true`:
 - `replaceContacts` - to replace both private and group contacts
 - `replacePrivateContacts` - to replace only private contacts
 - `replaceGroupContacts` - to replace only group contacts


```jsx
const userOptions = {
	// to replace both private and groups contacts 
	replaceContacts: true, 
	// to replace only private contacts
	replacePrivateContacts: true, 
	// to replace only group contacts 
	replaceGroupContacts: true
};

client.identify(yourUser, userOptions);
```
